# Semi-Global Weighted Least Squares in Image Filtering
 
This is the released code for the following paper:

"Semi-global weighted least squares in image filtering.", Wei Liu, Xiaogang Chen, Chuanhua Shen, Zhi Liu, and Jie Yang. In ICCV 2017.

**Update comments:**

The function *mexSG_WLS_opt* is the code-level optimized counterpart of the function *mexSG_WLS_naive*, it can produce the same results, but runs faster.
